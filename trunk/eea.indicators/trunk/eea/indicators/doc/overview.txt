We have skin folders installed. We have several workflows installed.
Test views. Test workflows. Test permissions.

Versioning
----------

Specifications have versions; a version of a specification is a new revision of the Spec; 
it is a completely restructured specification, with new format for Assessments. This is implemented
with eea.versions
 
Assessments have versions, each year the specifications get new assessments. 

When creating a new version of a Specification, the new specification is a copy of the old, 
with the following exceptions:

 * none of the assessments are copied
 * the work items are not copied
 * the rest of the contained content items are copied

When creating a new version of an Assessment, the new assessment is a copy of the old, 
with the following exceptions:

 * All the EEAFigures contained inside are copy of the ones in the previous assessment but must be linked as new versions of the figures in the older assessment.

EEAFigures inside an assessment cannot be versioned via the Plone GUI. Only when a user create a new Assessment new version of Figures are made and done by code (see above). 

When creating a new Assessment for a Specification, the Assessment should already contained
AssessmentParts created for all the PolicyQuestions

The Indicators Database
-----------------------

First, we have the Indicators Database (implemented in the class SpecificationsFolder):

    >>> self.loginAsPortalOwner()
    >>> id = self.portal.invokeFactory('SpecificationsFolder', 'ims')
    >>> ims = portal._getOb(id)
		>>> print ims
		<SpecificationsFolder at ims>

Inside the indicators database we can add Specifications

		>>> id = ims.invokeFactory("Specification", 'spec1')
		>>> spec1 = ims._getObj(id)
		>>> spec1
