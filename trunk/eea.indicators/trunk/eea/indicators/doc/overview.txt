Versioning
----------

Specifications have versions; a version of a specification is a new revision of the Spec; 
it is a completely restructured specification, with new format for Assessments. This is implemented
with eea.versions
 
Assessments have versions, each year the specifications get new assessments. 

When creating a new version of a Specification, the new specification is a copy of the old, 
with the following exceptions:

 * none of the assessments are copied
 * the work items are not copied
 * the rest of the contained content items are copied

When creating a new version of an Assessment, the new assessment is a copy of the old, 
with the following exceptions:

 * All the assessment parts are copied, but their text is erased
 * All the EEAFigures contained inside are erased????

When creating a new Assessment for a Specification, the Assessment should already contained
AssessmentParts created for all the PolicyQuestions

The Indicators Database
-----------------------

First, we have the Indicators Database (implemented in the class SpecificationsFolder):

    >>> self.loginAsPortalOwner()
    >>> id = self.portal.invokeFactory('SpecificationsFolder', 'ims')
    >>> ims = portal._getOb(id)
		>>> print ims
		<SpecificationsFolder at ims>

Inside the indicators database we can add Specifications

		>>> id = ims.invokeFactory("Specification", 'spec1')
		>>> spec1 = ims._getObj(id)
		>>> spec1
