We have several main content types. The most important are the Specification and their Assessments.

TODO: add getVersionId index in catalog

    >>> import urllib
    >>> import pprint
    >>> from Testing.testbrowser import Browser
    >>> from Products.PloneTestCase import PloneTestCase
    >>> from Products.CMFPlone.utils import getToolByName

    >>> self.loginAsPortalOwner()
    >>> browser = Browser()
    >>> browser.handleErrors = False
    >>> self.portal.error_log._ignored_exceptions = ()
    >>> browser.addHeader('Authorization',
    ...                   'Basic %s:%s' % (PloneTestCase.portal_owner,
    ...                                    PloneTestCase.default_password))
    >>> def types_in_container(container):
    ...     types = [t.__class__.__name__ for t in container.objectValues()]
    ...     return sorted(types)
    >>> catalog = portal.portal_catalog
    >>> indexes = catalog.indexes()
    >>> if 'getVersionId' not in indexes:
    ...     catalog.addIndex('getVersionId', 'FieldIndex')
    >>> def pp(obj):
    ...     v = obj.unrestrictedTraverse("@@get_readiness")
    ...     pprint.pprint(v.get_info_for('published'))
    ... 
    >>> from DateTime import DateTime
    >>> now = DateTime()


Containments
------------
The Specifications are implicitly addable. It is the duty of the portal manager to
create a special folder to store them.

    >>> id = portal.invokeFactory('Folder', 'ims')
    >>> ims = portal[id]

Inside this folder we will add Specifications:

    >>> id = ims.invokeFactory("Specification", 'spec1')
    >>> spec = ims[id]

Specifications are containers for several types of objects:

    >>> id = spec.invokeFactory(type_name="PolicyQuestion", id='pq', base_impl=True)
    >>> id = spec.invokeFactory(type_name="MethodologyReference", id="mr", base_impl=True)
    >>> id = spec.invokeFactory(type_name="RationaleReference", id="rr", base_impl=True)
    >>> id = spec.invokeFactory(type_name="WorkItem", id="wi", base_impl=True)
    >>> id = spec.invokeFactory(type_name="Assessment", id='as', base_impl=True)

An Assessment can contain AssessmentParts:

    >>> asst = spec['as']
    >>> ap = asst[asst.invokeFactory(type_name="AssessmentPart", id='ap')]

Inside the ims folder, where the Specification was created, we will also create several
other objects that can be referenced from the Specification.

    >>> id = ims.invokeFactory(type_name="ExternalDataSpec", id='eds')
    >>> id = ims.invokeFactory(type_name="PolicyDocumentReference", id='pdr')

EEAFigures sit in a separate folder, not under the IMS control:

    >>> ef = portal[portal.invokeFactory("EEAFigure", 'ef')]


Relationships
-------------
The IMS uses the relatedItems field to store all relationships. We use the eea.relations
widget and infrastructure to be able to specify which object a relation can contain.

    >>> reltool = portal['portal_relations']

Specifications can point to  PolicyDocumentReferences, ExternalDataSpecs and Data
(from eea.dataservice).

    >>> id = ims.invokeFactory("Data", 'dt')
    >>> spec.setRelatedItems([ims['dt'], ims['eds'], ims['pdr']])

AssessmentParts point to the answered PolicyQuestion and to various EEAFigures:

    >>> ap.setRelatedItems([spec['pq'], ef])

Installing the eea.indicators package will execute a setup step that installs new
objects in the portal_relations tools:

    >>> relations = getToolByName(portal, 'portal_relations')
    >>> ids = set(relations.objectIds())
    >>> our_ids = set(['specification', 'eea-data',
    ...                'policy-document-reference',
    ...                'specification-eea-data',
    ...                'specification-policy-document-reference'])

TODO: add new content from updated possible_relations.xml

#    >>> ids.intersection(our_ids) == our_ids
#    True


Versioning and utility views
----------------------------

Editing the IMS should be done through a modified Edit form, which aggregates
all content into a single view, to make editing the tree of objects easier.

    >>> spec = ims[ims.invokeFactory("Specification", 'spec2')]
    >>> spec_url = spec.absolute_url()

Object factories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One important feature are the object factories: this is a concept were we
customize the process of creating an object.

Note: these object factories are not the same as the ones from Plone.

The following objects are created in the Edit view of Specification through object factories:

    >>> browser.open("%s/object_factory?type_name=RationaleReference" % spec_url)
    >>> browser.open("%s/object_factory?type_name=WorkItem" % spec_url)
    >>> browser.open("%s/object_factory?type_name=MethodologyReference" % spec_url)
    >>> browser.open("%s/object_factory?type_name=PolicyQuestion" % spec_url)
    >>> browser.open("%s/object_factory?type_name=Assessment" % spec_url)
    >>> print types_in_container(spec)
    ['Assessment', 'MethodologyReference', 'PolicyQuestion', 'RationaleReference', 'WorkItem']

An newly created Assessment should already have an AssessmentPart created, linked to the already
created PolicyQuestion.

    >>> assessment = spec.objectValues('Assessment')[0]
    >>> assessment.objectValues()
    [<AssessmentPart at ...>]
    >>> ap = assessment.objectValues('AssessmentPart')[0]
    >>> pq = spec.objectValues('PolicyQuestion')[0]
    >>> ap.getRelatedItems()[0] == pq
    True

Versioning
~~~~~~~~~~
We need a specification with assessments that link to EEAFigures, so let's
make sure we have some.

    >>> figures = portal[portal.invokeFactory("Folder", 'figures')]
    >>> figure_1 = figures[figures.invokeFactory("EEAFigure", 'f1')]
    >>> print figure_1
    <EEAFigure at ...>
    >>> related = ap.getRelatedItems()
    >>> ap.setRelatedItems(related + [figure_1])

Specifications have versions; a version of a specification is a new revision
of the Spec; it is a completely restructured specification, with new format
for Assessments. This is implemented with eea.versions

Assessments have versions, for example, each year the specifications might
get new assessments.

When creating a new version of a Specification, the new specification is
a copy of the old, with the following exceptions:

 * none of the assessments are copied
 * the work items are not copied
 * the rest of the contained content items are copied

    >>> version_url = spec.unrestrictedTraverse('@@createVersion')()
    >>> print version_url
    http://nohost/plone/ims/spec2-1
    >>> versioned_spec = ims[version_url.split('/')[-1]]
    >>> print types_in_container(versioned_spec)
    ['MethodologyReference', 'PolicyQuestion', 'RationaleReference']

When creating a new version of an Assessment, the new assessment is a copy of the old,
with the following exceptions:

 * The new AssessmentParts will point to the latest version of the EEAFigures that
   were referenced by the old AssessmentParts

    >>> assessment_part = assessment.objectValues('AssessmentPart')[0]
    >>> #print sorted([o.__class__.__name__ for o in assessment_part.getRelatedItems()])

    >>> from eea.indicators.browser.assessment import create_version as assessment_create_version
    >>> from eea.versions.versions import create_version as base_create_version
    >>> versioned_figure = base_create_version(figure_1)
    >>> versioned_assessment = assessment_create_version(assessment)
    >>> print versioned_assessment
    <Assessment at ...>
    >>> assessment_part = versioned_assessment.objectValues('AssessmentPart')[0]
    >>> print sorted([o.__class__.__name__ for o in assessment_part.getRelatedItems()])
    ['EEAFigure', 'PolicyQuestion']
    >>> figure_2 = filter(lambda x:x.meta_type=='EEAFigure', assessment_part.getRelatedItems())[0]
    >>> figure_2.absolute_url() == versioned_figure.absolute_url()
    True

Versioning again the new assessment will result in the EEAFigure being preserved,
as there is no more another newer version:

    >>> versioned_assessment_2 = assessment_create_version(versioned_assessment)
    >>> assessment_part = versioned_assessment_2.objectValues('AssessmentPart')[0]
    >>> figure_2 = filter(lambda x:x.meta_type=='EEAFigure', assessment_part.getRelatedItems())[0]
    >>> figure_2.absolute_url() == versioned_figure.absolute_url()
    True

Adding a new Assessment will already create it as a version of the previous one.

When creating a new Assessment in a Specification that is versioned, that assessments
needs to have the same versionid (group id) as the previous assessments.

    >>> browser.open("%s/object_factory?type_name=Assessment" % version_url)
    >>> ast = versioned_spec.objectValues("Assessment")[0]
    >>> versions = ast.unrestrictedTraverse('@@getVersions').versions()
    >>> print versions
    [<Assessment at /plone/ims/spec2/assessment>, <Assessment at /plone/ims/spec2/assessment-1>, <Assessment at /plone/ims/spec2/assessment-2>, <Assessment at /plone/ims/spec2-1/assessment>]
    >>> assert len(versions) > 1

TODO: at this moment we need to use the special object factory to achieve this.
In the future it would be good to be able to use the regular invokeFactory call.

When creating a new Assessment for a Specification, the Assessment should already contain
AssessmentParts created for all the PolicyQuestions - this is already demonstrated above.


Catalog Indexes
---------------
We index the codes of a Specification using the get_codes index. First, let's
test if it's installed:

    >>> catalog = getToolByName(portal, 'portal_catalog')
    >>> 'get_codes' in catalog.indexes()
    True

There is some cleanup done for codes input in Specification.setCodes():

    >>> spec.setCodes([{}])
    >>> spec.getCodes()
    ()
    >>> spec.setCodes([{'set':'CSI', 'code':'001'}])
    >>> spec.getCodes()
    ({'code': '001', 'set': 'CSI'},)
    >>> spec.setCodes([{'set':'CSI', 'code':''}])
    >>> spec.getCodes()
    ()
    >>> spec.setCodes([{'set':'CSI', 'code':'001'}, {'set':'TERM', 'code':'002'}])
    >>> spec.getCodes()
    ({'code': '001', 'set': 'CSI'}, {'code': '002', 'set': 'TERM'})

Specification.get_codes() will return a structure that can be used to find Specs in
catalog searches based on either the full code or the Set code:

    >>> spec.get_codes()
    ['CSI', 'CSI001', 'TERM', 'TERM002']

Indexing this object, as it is required in a test later on:

    >>> catalog.indexObject(spec)


Readiness for publication
-------------------------
We have a system that uses eea.workflow to decide if a Specification is ready to be published.

    >>> spec = ims[ims.invokeFactory("Specification", 'spec3')]

First, we have a portlet that shows the readiness state for a Specification. This portlet
overrides and includes the same portlet from eea.workflow and the main difference is that
it is an AJAX reloadable version of the original. For the AJAX call we use portlet_readiness_live
(we couldn't use portlet_readiness because of the way it is defined at the level of
the Specification class)

    >>> res = spec.unrestrictedTraverse("portlet_readiness_live")()   #+NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    >>> "object_readiness" in res
    True

This portlet uses a special view that is registered on objects that
implement eea.workflow.interfaces.IHasMandatoryWorkflowFields:

    >>> view = spec.unrestrictedTraverse('@@get_readiness')
    >>> info = view.get_info_for('published')

    >>> state_name = 'published'
    >>> from eea.workflow.readiness import OTHER_METADATA_FIELDS
    >>> from zope.component import getMultiAdapter
    >>> from eea.workflow.interfaces import IFieldIsRequiredForState
    >>> def get_required_for_published(context):
    ...     i = 0
    ...     for field in context.schema.fields():
    ...         if field.isMetadata or field.getName in OTHER_METADATA_FIELDS:
    ...             continue
    ...         required_for = getMultiAdapter((context, field), interface=IFieldIsRequiredForState)
    ...         is_needed = required_for(state_name)
    ...         if is_needed:
    ...             i += 1
    ...     return i
    ...
    >>> total_fields = get_required_for_published(spec) + info['conditions']
    >>> def percentage(val):
    ...     return int(float(val) /total_fields * 100.0)

A specification has 21 fields.

NOTE plone4: they used to be 22. What happened?

From these, 13 are required to be able to transition to
'published'. We also have a number of 5 extra checks, so we count 18 required fields.

The call to get_info_for() returns a mapping with the
keys 'rfs_done', 'rfs_required', 'rfs_with_value', 'optional_empty', 'total_fields', 'extras'

'rfs_done' tells us the percentage of the content that is required for the desired state.
By default the title is filled in and one condition is True, so we will be at 11% (2.0 * 100 /17.0):

    >>> info['rfs_done'] == percentage(2)
    True

'rfs_required' is the number of fields that are required to be filled in for that state.

    >>> info['rfs_required'] == total_fields
    True

'rfs_with_value' is the number of fields that have content filled in and are required for that state.
The title field is filled in, and the condition that checks that the
specification doesn't have an invalid specification code.

    >>> info['rfs_with_value']
    2

'optional_empty' is the number of fields that are not required for that state and don't have a value.

    >>> info['optional_empty']
    9

'total_fields' is the grand total number of fields. There are 21 fields

    >>> info['total_fields']
    22

Let's fill in another field, this time 'codes':

    >>> spec.setCodes([{'set':'BLA', 'code':'005'}, {'set':'IRENA', 'code':'006'}])
    >>> catalog.reindexObject(spec)
    >>> view = spec.unrestrictedTraverse('@@get_readiness')
    >>> info = view.get_info_for('published')
    >>> info['rfs_done'] == percentage(3)
    True

    >>> info['rfs_with_value']
    3

The get_readiness view can also tell us if the object is ready for publishing:

    >>> view.is_ready_for('published')
    False

Let's move on making this spec ready for publishing:

    >>> spec.setDpsir('D')
    >>> spec.setTypology('A')
    >>> spec.setRationale_justification(u'something or other')
    >>> spec.setPolicy_context_description(u'something and other')
    >>> spec.setDefinition(u'something and other')
    >>> spec.setUnits(u'something and other')
    >>> spec.setMethodology(u'something and other')
    >>> spec.setManager_user_id(u'something')
    >>> spec.setThemes([u'something'])
    >>> spec.setOwnership([u'something'])
    >>> updates = spec.getFrequency_of_updates()
    >>> frequency = ([{'time_of_year':'Q1', 'years_freq':'2'}], {})
    >>> updates['frequency'] = frequency
    >>> updates['starting_date'] = now
    >>> spec.setFrequency_of_updates(updates)
    >>> catalog.reindexObject(spec)

We have to introduce more then one word in the richtext fields because we have an adapter
that considers valid values only text with more then 2 words.

All required fields are filled in, but the extra checks are not met:

Now we should be at 88% (round(15*100/17)):

    >>> info = spec.unrestrictedTraverse('@@get_readiness').get_info_for('published')

    >>> info['rfs_done'] == percentage(15)
    True
    >>> info['rfs_with_value']
    15

We have 13 in the rfs_with_value variable because we have 12 real fields + one extra check
that is fulfilled, which checks if we have a primary theme.

It's not yet ready for published because there's an override to the default provided eea.workflow
get_readiness that adds a few extra checks: we need to have at least one
main policy question and some related items:

    >>> id = spec.invokeFactory(type_name="PolicyQuestion", id='pq', base_impl=True)
    >>> pq = spec.objectValues('PolicyQuestion')[0]
    >>> pq.setIs_key_question(True)
    >>> spec.setRelatedItems([ims['dt'], ims['eds'], ims['pdr']])
    >>> spec.unrestrictedTraverse('@@get_readiness').is_ready_for('published')
    True

We'll reindex this object because we need it later for some entries in the catalog.

    >>> catalog = getToolByName(portal, 'portal_catalog')
    >>> catalog.reindexObject(spec)

Assessment readiness for publication:

    >>> id = spec.invokeFactory(type_name="Assessment", id='asp')
    >>> asp = spec[id]

By default, a newly created assessment is not ready to be published:

    >>> asp.unrestrictedTraverse('@@get_readiness').is_ready_for('published')
    False

We need to set the key message, set a figure as related and publish the specification:

#TODO: refactor test to use figure.setLocation instead of
setGeographicCoverage, as geographicCoverage has been deprecated

    >>> asp.setKey_message("something or other")
    >>> ap = asp.objectValues("AssessmentPart")[0]
    >>> rels = ap.getRelatedItems()
    >>> ap.setRelatedItems(rels + [figure_1])
    >>> figure_1.setGeographicCoverage(["ro", 'it', 'dk'])
    >>> figure_1.setTemporalCoverage(["1990"])
    >>> figure_1.setRelatedItems([ims['eds']])
    >>> figure_1.setTitle("Figure 1")
    >>> figure_1.setDataOwner("someone")
    >>> figure_1.setFigureType("map")
    >>> figure_1.setContact("someone here")
    >>> ap.setAssessment("something or other")
    >>> asp.unrestrictedTraverse('@@get_readiness').is_ready_for('published')
    False
    >>> wftool = portal.portal_workflow
    >>> try:    #there's an exception in a EEAContentTypes workflow script that can be ignored
    ...     wftool.doActionFor(spec, 'quickPublish')
    ... except:
    ...     pass
    >>> print wftool.getInfoFor(spec, 'review_state')
    published
    >>> ap.setAssessment("assessment comes here")
    >>> asp.unrestrictedTraverse('@@get_readiness').is_ready_for('published')
    False

The management plan needs to be filled in:

    >>> asp.setManagement_plan((2001, '1.2.3'))
    >>> catalog.reindexObject(asp)
    >>> info = asp.unrestrictedTraverse('@@get_readiness').get_info_for('published')
    >>> asp.unrestrictedTraverse('@@get_readiness').is_ready_for('published')
    True


Simple field editing and schemata editing
-----------------------------------------

In the new aggregated edit view we use two types of editing dialog boxes:

 * one where we edit just one field
 * another one where we edit a full schemata

Single field dialog edit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single field edit forms are based on a modified base_edit.cpt template that presents a
single field.

    >>> baseurl = spec.absolute_url()
    >>> browser.open(baseurl + '/simple_edit?fieldset=default&specific_field=title')
    >>> print browser.contents  #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    <... <form ... id="specification-base-edit"...

Inside we will have the field:

    >>> title = browser.getControl(name='title')

The submit button is created by javascript, through the jQuery UI framework.
Submiting the form, if the form is properly validated, will return a small Javascript
fragment that closes the dialog and reloads the region to which that field belongs:

    >>> req = {'specific_field':'title', 'fieldset':'default', 'title':'Some title',
    ...        'form.submitted':'1', 'form_submit':'Save'}
    >>> data = urllib.urlencode(req)
    >>> browser.open(baseurl + '/simple_edit', data=data)
    >>> print browser.contents  #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    <script>...closer(...'title'...)...</script>

Schemata dialog edit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Several content types can be edited from the aggregated edit view in a full popup edit form.
They are: WorkItems, MethodologyReferences, RationaleReferences and PolicyQuestions

    >>> pq = spec.objectValues('PolicyQuestion')[0]
    >>> url = pq.absolute_url()
    >>> browser.open(url + '/schemata_edit?fieldset=default')
    >>> browser.getControl(name="title").value = 'First question'
    >>> browser.getForm(name="edit_form").submit()
    >>> print browser.contents        #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    <script>...close_dialog...</script>

If the form that was submited fails validation, it is redisplayed. Because we have edited
the title, the PolicyQuestion's id was changed, so let's get it again.

    >>> url = pq.absolute_url()
    >>> browser.open(url + '/schemata_edit?fieldset=default')
    >>> browser.getControl(name="title").value = ''
    >>> browser.getForm(name="edit_form").submit()
    >>> print browser.contents        #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    <...form...>


Specification codes validation
------------------------------
We have a soft requirement that we shouldn't have Specifications with the same
codeset that are not versions of each other.

We already have a spec with code CSI001, we'll have another one with the same
code

    >>> id = ims.invokeFactory("Specification", 'spec4')
    >>> spec = ims[id]
    >>> spec.setCodes([{'set':'CSI', 'code':'001'}])

The portlet_readiness will inform us of the situation:

    >>> pp(spec)
    {...is already used by some other document in IMS...

The fragment_metadata, which contains the codes, will tell us that the CSI001
code is duplicated and offer a link to link it as a version of the other specification:

    >>> #browser.handleErrors = False
    >>> browser.open(spec.absolute_url() + '/fragment_metadata')
    >>> print browser.contents  #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    <...Unrelated Indicators Specifications have the same codes...CSI001...@@assign_version...


Reassigning versions for Specifications
---------------------------------------
When manually reasigning versions for a specification, we want to reassign versions for
its children assessments as well.

    >>> from eea.versions.interfaces import IGetVersions
    >>> from eea.indicators.browser.specification import create_version as spec_create_version
    >>> from eea.indicators.browser.assessment import create_version as assessment_create_version

    >>> version_factories = {
    ...     "Specification":spec_create_version,
    ...     "Assessment":assessment_create_version
    ... }
    >>> def make_version(obj):
    ...     factory = version_factories[obj.meta_type]
    ...     return factory(obj)

    >>> def make_obj(parent, type_name, id):
    ...     if type_name == "Assessment":
    ...         return parent[parent.invokeFactory(type_name=type_name, id=id, base_impl=True)]
    ...     else:
    ...         return parent[parent.invokeFactory(type_name=type_name, id=id)]

    >>> spec5  = make_obj(ims, "Specification", 'spec5')
    >>> vspec5 = make_version(spec5)
    >>> as5    = make_obj(spec5, "Assessment", 'as5')
    >>> vas5   = make_version(as5)
    >>> as6    = make_obj(spec5, "Assessment", "as6")
    >>> vas6   = make_version(as6)
    >>> spec6  = make_obj(ims, "Specification", 'spec6')
    >>> vspec6 = make_version(spec6)

Each object involved has a different version id:

    >>> vs5, vs6 = IGetVersions(vspec5).versionId, IGetVersions(vspec6).versionId
    >>> va5, va6 = IGetVersions(vas5).versionId, IGetVersions(vas6).versionId
    >>> len(set([va5, vs5, vs6, va6])) == 4
    True
    >>> from eea.indicators.browser.specification import spec_assign_version
    >>> spec_assign_version(spec6, vs5)
    >>> IGetVersions(spec6).versionId == vs5
    True
    >>> IGetVersions(as6).versionId == va5
    True


Frequency of updates
--------------------

The frequency of updates field is set on the Specification and impacts when
new assessments can be created. We have a method that displays labels for
users in both assessment and specifications, letting them know when they can
expect new updates.

    >>> spec = ims['spec1']
    >>> print spec.get_frequency_of_updates()
    Required information is not filled in: Information about the starting date of the publishing schedule is missing.

Fill in time_of_year and years frequency

    >>> updates = spec.getFrequency_of_updates()
    >>> frequency = ([{'time_of_year':'Q1', 'years_freq':'2'}], {})
    >>> updates['frequency'] = frequency
    >>> updates['starting_date'] = now
    >>> spec.setFrequency_of_updates(updates)
    >>> print spec.get_frequency_of_updates()
    Updates are scheduled every 2 year(s) in January-March (Q1)

Setting an ending date in the future has no impact in what is shown:

    >>> ending = now + 10   #10 days in the future
    >>> updates['ending_date'] = ending
    >>> spec.setFrequency_of_updates(updates)
    >>> print spec.get_frequency_of_updates()
    Updates are scheduled every 2 year(s) in January-March (Q1)
    >>> print spec.is_discontinued()
    False

Setting the ending date in the past will prevent new assessments from being
created:

    >>> ending = now - 10   #10 days in the past
    >>> updates['ending_date'] = ending
    >>> spec.setFrequency_of_updates(updates)
    >>> print spec.get_frequency_of_updates()
    This indicator is discontinued. No more assessments will be produced.
    >>> print spec.is_discontinued()
    True
