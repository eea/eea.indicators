Frequency of updates
====================

This document is intended to track details on functionality of frequency 
of updates field and its development. It is a more coherent copy of comments 
entered on the ticket http://taskman.eionet.europa.eu/issues/14361


Field description
-----------------
Frequency of updates describes how often new versions of Assessments are 
produced for an indicator.

Frequency of updates is a composite field with 4 sub-fields:

 * Frequency (years): The indicator is published. 
   Every <select integer 1-10> years. Default: none [REQUIRED]
 * Time of the year: Select Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. Default: none [REQUIRED]
 * Starting date: date picker. Default: see below [REQUIRED]
 * Ending date: date picker. default None. [OPTIONAL]. 
   This date defaults to expiration date. Setting it has the effect of setting
   an expiration date.

Make sure user enter proper value and that defaults are not just stored
without user noticing it. Time of year should not have a default value.

This field is editable from the aggregated edit of Specification, and it's
placed in the metadata section. Here, it should always show what the real
values are entered.

Frequency of update info is Specification-specific, that means it apply only
to the current specification and its children assessments. When a new
specification version is made the "Frequency of update" is copied over to the
new version. So, different specifications may have different frequency of
updates.


Default value of starting date:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Frequency of update > starting date" will default as "None". It must be
entered by Indicator manager. It indicates from when the frequency of update
scheduling is valid.


Readiness for publication
-------------------------
The entire field is "Required for Published" for Specification. If not filled
in it must appear in the completeness report. If field is missing write
feedback as follow: "Information about frequency of update for this indicator
is missing." If indicator expired, then a very visible box appears saying
indicator has been discontinued.


Information display
-------------------
This information is shown both in the specification and assessment. This
information is shown in the metadata box, near bottom. When indicator has been
terminated, then show a very visible box at the top, informing that the
indicator has been discontinued.

If the field is not properly filled in, don't show anything in the views.


Ending date/expiration date
---------------------------
If we have an end-date (expiration date) on specification AND it has passed, 
it has the following effects:

 * Creation of new assessment versions is disabled. Editors can't create new 
   assessment and specification versions.
 * a very visible box on the indicator page show that it is discontinued

Ending date MUST NOT be synched to EXPIRATION DATE. Because we do not
want the case when a frequency of update ends on a certain date and indicators
that are just one year old disappears from searches, it is too aggressive.


Need input from editors group
