Instalation
===========

This product is installable from the Plone Control Panel / Add/Remove Products page. In the case of a 
busy website with a large catalog, it is advisable that the following portal_setup steps are manually 
applied (of course, with the eea.indicators profile activated):

	* manual coded post-install for indicators
	* eea.indicators: Install vocabularies with ATVocabularyManager
	* eea.indicators: Setup various
	* Update Workflow role mappings for indicators
	* Role / Permission Map
	* Skins Tool
	* Types Tool
	* Workflow Tool
	* Portal Factory Tool
	* Javascript registry
	* Catalog Tool
	* Stylesheet registry
	* Possible Relations Settings


Dependencies
------------

We have several dependencies that need to be installed. Let's test that they are installed.

	>>> from Products.CMFCore.utils import getToolByName

First, we depend on eea.relations:

	>>> relations = getToolByName(portal, 'portal_relations')

We also depend on eea.dataservice, but we don't want to override the customizations in the live
site, so we won't actually dependend on it. Also eea.facetednavigation, ATVocabularyManager and RedirectionTool.

#>>> typestools = getToolByName(portal, 'portal_types')
#>>> types = typestools.listContentTypes()
#>>> ('EEAFigure' in types) and ('Data' in types) 
#True

We depend on Products.DataGridField:

	>>> print portal.datagridwidget
	<FSPageTemplate at datagridwidget>

Products.UserAndGroupSelectionWidget:

	>>> print portal.userandgroupselect
	<FSPageTemplate at userandgroupselect>

eea.workflow:

	>>> print portal.portlet_readiness
	<FSPageTemplate at portlet_readiness>

eea.versions:

	>>> print portal.portlet_versions
	<FSPageTemplate at portlet_versions>
